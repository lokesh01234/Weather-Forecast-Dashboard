Design a Weather Forecast Dashboard<br>
In this weather Dashboard project, users can enter any city name to get the 5-day weather forecast including temperature, wind speed, humidity, and more.<br>
This project is also mobile-friendly, which means it looks great on all devices.<br>
To create this first I create three file index.html, style.css, script.js<br>
In html file, code includes a weather app header, input, button, and unordered list (ul) that are used as a placeholder for weather details. Later, using JavaScript, i will replace these placeholders with actual weather details.<br>
Next, add the following CSS codes to your style.css file to apply visual styling to your weather app. Use CSS Media Queries to make application responsive, looking good on both desktop and mobile.<br>
Finally, add the following JavaScript code to your script.js file. This script code will make your weather app functional. Use OpenWeatherMap API to fetch live weather forecast<br>
In the code, there are two API calls. The first one fetches the geographic coordinates of the user-entered city. These coordinates are then used in the second API call to retrieve the weather forecast, which is displayed on the page.
